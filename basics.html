                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses technology designed to mimic human behavior and intelligence. This includes responding to user inputs, solving problems, and making decisions.</p>

                    <h2>Who Created AI?</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>Despite the recent influx of AI based conversations, the concept of Artificial Intelligence dates back to 400 BCE when philosophers would contemplate the term “automaton”, which translates to “acting of one’s own will”. That said, it wasn’t until the 1920’s that the world began experimenting with the concept of an artificial brain.
        
                        By the 1950’s, familiar names such as Alan Turning, publisher of the Computer Machinery and Intelligence test, and Arthur Samuel, developer of the Checkers program which allows a one player option, began to appear. Names such as these two men were just the beginning of the AI boom. Eventually names such as John McCarthy (LISP), The American Association of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), Cynthia Breazeal (first robot to simulate human emotion), and SIRI (Apple co.), would further push the AI industry into our everyday lives.  
                        
                        Aspects of our daily lives began to change as AI aloud for automatic doors, one player games, and social media algorithms began to become an expectation in modern day society. So why the sudden concern?  
                        
                        As of 2015, OpenAI, a San Fransisco startup, created a program known as ChatGPT. This program, which had the ability to have a conversation or write whatever it was prompted to write, would soon be seen as a plagiarism-like act that many educators would then blame all of AI for. However, the term “AI” is not only a lot larger than ChatGPT, but also includes other pros and cons in the education environment.  </p>

                    <p>AI has been ingrained in more than just our computers. Simple programs are all that are needed when it comes to the definition of AI (“any kind of technology created to act like or in place of another human”). Here we have listed some everyday examples that we have all grown used to: automatic doors, one player computer games, phone assistants, streaming services, social media , automatic soap dispensers, automated phone calls, and AI chat assistants. </p>
