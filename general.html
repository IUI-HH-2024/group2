        <h3>Ethical Concerns and Implications</h3>
        <p>AI technology and programs can be seen as a source of serious ethical concerns, particularly in regards to personal privacy and autonomy. Many critics argue that AI can lead to a potential increase in a general decline in intellect or oneâ€™s ability to learn.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="opinion-box">
        <h3>Job Displacement</h3>
        <p>Probably the most common argument against the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence is the potential for the displacement of many jobs. As AI becomes more complex and intelligent, there is fear that these systems will replace humans, leading to significant unemployment rates. However, supporters argue that AI will also create new opportunities requiring new, modern skills for employment.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="opinion-box">
        <h3>Decision Making</h3>
        <p>Many detractors worry that over-reliance on artificial intelligence could lead to potentially biased or unclear decision-making if AI systems are not regulated and audited. Supporters argue that if used properly, AI can eliminate human biases and make decision-making easier, fairer, and more efficient.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="opinion-box">
        <h3>Social Interaction</h3>
        <p>The impact of AI on social interaction is another area of contention. Some worry that AI technologies such as virtual assistants and chatbots may diminish human interaction, leading to a decrease in social skills. Conversely, for those with disabilities, AI could provide new methods of communication and be a significant enhancement.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="opinion-box">
        <h3>Regulation</h3>
        <p>Regulating AI is a crucial and complex issue. Detractors demand strict regulations to manage the ethical and societal risks of AI, arguing for transparency to protect the public. Meanwhile, supporters stress the need for regulatory flexibility to support innovation and technological growth while safeguarding public interests.</p>
