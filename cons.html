        <h2>Concerns of AI in the Classroom</h2>
        <p>The debate for AI in the classroom has been known to swing against its use. According to various sources, these are the reasons for concerns:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cheating:</strong> According to Pewresearch, 1 in 5 students have used ChatGPT for their schoolwork. Many educators view the use of AI written content as plagiarized. According to Business Insider, this has led to an increase of documented cheating and an increase of chastised students.  </p>
        
        <p><strong>A Decrease in Educational Skills:</strong>Many educators have expressed their frustration when grading papers and projects that are created by AI. Claiming it to not only be a problem for the studentâ€™s education, but a concern in the teacher/student relationship when the student is caught.  </p>
        
        <p><strong>Educator Frustration and Jeopardized Relationships:</strong> Educators often express frustration with AI-generated assignments, which can lead to distrust and damaged relationships if students pass off AI work as their own, especially where AI use is prohibited.</p>

        <p><strong>Bias:</strong> Although AI tends to be depicted in media as thinking for itself, the program itself is only as smart as the one who created it. Waldon University explains that AI is not something to be feared, but rather something to be wary about due to the biases that a program may have. These biases will be based on what information the AI has been given.  </p>
       
        <p><strong>Updating State Standards:</strong> AMost states and school systems have learning goals that educators are to follow, and students are to meet each year. According to CRPE, due to the increased use of AI in the classroom, states have begun to differ in their view of how state standards should engage, or object, to AI in their education systems.  </p>

        <p><strong>Inaccurate Information:</strong> Tech for America explains how most AI systems go to large search engines such as Google for information to write about. Due to these search engines' lack of filtering information, many AI generated writings will include opinions, conspiracy theories, and false information.  </p>
            
        <p><strong>Isolation:</strong>Waldon University also states isolation as an increasing issue with AI. As students begin to interact with AI for projects and essays, there becomes less of a need to go to outside sources or partners for any form of collaboration.   </p>
