        <h2>Challenges of AI in the Classroom</h2>
        <p><strong>Cheating:</strong> AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude have enabled students to bypass traditional writing processes, leading to increased cheating and challenges in enforcing academic integrity policies.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Lack of Writing Skills:</strong> With AI capable of generating complete essays, students are increasingly showing deficiencies in their writing skills and understanding of how to structure various assignments.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Educator Frustration and Jeopardized Relationships:</strong> Educators often express frustration with AI-generated assignments, which can lead to distrust and damaged relationships if students pass off AI work as their own, especially where AI use is prohibited.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Conflict with State Standards:</strong> Many educational standards, including specific writing benchmarks, may not be met if students rely heavily on AI for assignment completion, posing a conflict with mandated learning goals.</p>
