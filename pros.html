        <h2>Helpful AI in the Classroom</h2>
        <p><strong>Not only has AI already been implemented in the classroom, but there are benefits that can still be had in the classroom environment. Since AI was implemented in the classrooms, educators and students have seen an increase in learning and participation. These implementations look like the following:</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>New Forms of Communication:</strong> According to the Office of Educational Technology text-to-words and varying communication apps allow students to communicate when they have verbal or neurological disabilities. </p>
        <p><strong>Language Barrier </strong> The language barrier that many classrooms face has become easier as AI has provided easy translations via computers in the classroom.  </p>
        <p><strong>Personalized Feedback:</strong> According to eLearning Industry, most writing forums (Word, Google Docs, etc.) have aloud educators to give personalized and specific feedback that can be typed and addressed. These personalizing programs are also able to gauge a student’s learning level and work at that student’s level. Other programs such as Grammarly and Spell Check are encouraged by many educators when assigning an essay for students to write. These programs have features that include flagging when something is spelled wrong, or if the grammar is incorrect. Some programs even allow for the user to express what they wish for the program to flag if found in their writing.  </p>
        <p><strong>New Educational Tools:</strong> A varying degree of educational tools have developed with AI. Many educational programs such as Math XL, Waterford, BrainPop, and more have been created to help with visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learners (Kodable). Due to the varying types of learners educators are faced with, programs with basic AI programming such as these help students to work at their own pace and practice in their own ways.  </p>
        <p><strong>Engaging students with technology and tech-driven projects </strong> </p>
        <p><strong>Educator time savers </strong> Edutopia has found many teachers use AI in their lesson planning. Not only does AI shorten educators’ planning time, but allow for creativity that better captures the attention of students (ie: using AI to generate images and project ideas).  

 </p>
            
        <h2>AI Assisting with Disabilities</h2>
        <p>AI has become a tool for disabled or emotionally challenges individuals. The Institute of Education Sciences argues AI has already made a large impact on the classroom environment. These changes include providing programs that help ED students regulate others’ emotions, changing the font and size of text for dyslexic students, providing text-to-word programs for students with verbal disabilities, and error analysis.  </p>
        
        <h2>Preparing Students for a Future with AI</h2>
        <p>Education weekly teaches how involving AI in everyday education will prepare students for the changes that AI is currently implementing and will continue to change in the workforce. </p>
