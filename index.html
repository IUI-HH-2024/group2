            <h2>Welcome to Our Website</h2>
            <p>Welcome all educators, parents, students, and lawmakers who work with or are affiliated with education! We wish to provide the best information about AI for your curiosity and educational benefits!</p>

            <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to educate others on the implementation of AI in classrooms. With education being our only goal, we wish to provide current and relevant understanding of what AI is, how it impacts education, and arguments for and against its use.</p>

        <section id="about-us">
            <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
            <p>We are a group of Graduate students in IU Indianapolis’ Library and Informatic Sciences program. Having spent the past semester learning about and studying the benefits of a reliable and accessible website, we have collaborated to create a reliable and accessible website that will inform about the topic of AI in education.</p>

        <section id="importance">
            <h2>Why This Topic Is Important</h2>
            <p>AI has begun to infiltrate a variety of organizations and businesses within the past few years. Due to its growing popularity, it is important to know how it affects everyday living. Providing both benefits and challenges to everyday activities, we believe a better understanding will help the average citizen to better use, or not use, this programming.</p>

        <section id="focus">
            <h2>Why Focus on AI in Education</h2>
            <p>Education was not the first to be impacted by AI, but there has been a rise in the use and complaints against AI since it has hit the education field. With both students and educators wishing to know more about, and wanting to interact with AI, we feel it is important to have a website that can answer questions as to what AI is and how it changes life in the classroom.</p>
